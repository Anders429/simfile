This is a collection of `.msd` files for integration testing. These files were collected from
various places online, and are authentic files originally created to be used with `DDR99.exe`.

Many of these files are encoded as `SHIFT_JIS`. This is the same encoding that was used in and
supported by `DDR99.exe` and other accompanying programs like `MSDSHOW.exe` (used for `.msd` file
creation).

Note that no audio or image files are included.  Interestingly, no music files were found
accompanying any of these `.msd` files on any of the old websites that hosted them. If you're
looking for the other files, you'll have to look elsewhere.
